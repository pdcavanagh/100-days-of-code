# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created quote generator project site using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. 

**Thoughts:** Basic site is build with a quick styling. Randomly selecting a quote from a manually created JSON file. This could easily be extended to a database or API call for more quotes. Tweet button put in as placeholder. Bootstrap is overkill for this project, but could come in handy for a more complex buildout of the project.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
